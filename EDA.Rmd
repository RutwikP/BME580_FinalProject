#Loading Data 
```{r cars}
hip_fracture_df = read_sav('../Analysis/Data/HipFractureQualityData.sav')
```


```{r cars}
#first off lets get a summary of the data to see what is missing. We want to look more closely at the encoded columns (Starting at Gender = 1) since we would not expect NA's here
options(max.print = 4000)
summary(hip_fracture_df)

#it looks like there are no NA's being displayed - it may be mis- encoding them when we read in the data


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
