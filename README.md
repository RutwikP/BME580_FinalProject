# BME580_FinalProject

This is our repository for our BME 580 project investigating the relationships between race and hospital readmission following hip fracture surgery. Our data is being housed in Box and must be downloaded locally in order to run the rmd files. Note the file path in the rmd files must be adjusted to your local file path once you have downloaded the data.
