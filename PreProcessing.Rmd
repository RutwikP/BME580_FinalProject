```{r}

#not sure if we should keep 
table(df_no_leaks$ELECTSURG)

#3 leveled variable
table(df_no_leaks$DIABETES)

#look at weight loss - currently not encoded
table(df_no_leaks$WTLOSS)

#CPT code only has unique values so we will want to use and probably encode it later, work RVU we can keep as is for now, age we can keep as is for now
table(df_no_leaks$CPT)

#looks like all but 78 cases were outpatient, will probably drop this column 
table(df_no_leaks$INOUT)

#we will keep this column 
table(df_no_leaks$AGE)

#Will probably not use surgspec because vast majority are ortho  
table(df_no_leaks$SURGSPEC)
```

Now let's look at the missing data.

First is observing the numerical data to observe the list
```{r}
#options(max.print = 4000)
#summary(train_full)
#sum(is.na(train_full))
```

```{r}
train_full_copy1 <- data.frame(df_simplified)
missing1 <- data.frame(map(train_full_copy1, ~sum(is.na(.))))
missing1 <- missing1[ , colSums(missing1 != 0, na.rm = TRUE) > 0]
sum(missing1)

train_full_copy2 <- data.frame(df_simplified)
train_full_copy2[train_full_copy2 == -99] <- NA
missing2 <- data.frame(map(train_full_copy2, ~sum(is.na(.))))
missing2 <- missing2[ , colSums(missing2 != 0, na.rm = TRUE) > 0]
sum(missing2)
```

It appears that there are 2 columns (BLEED_UNITS_TOT and casematch22) include missing value, in addition, there are another 65 columns encode missing value with "-99". In the training set, we have 29188 observations. We can set up a threshold, and if the NA counts of the column greater than it should be excluded from analysis. The rationale of considering -99 as missing value is because columns such as Height and weight.

However, there are other parameters that should not be negative is negative: BMI, but it is not -99. Further looking into the data set, on can observe that BMI < 0 happens when there is at least 1 missing value appear in either HEIGHT or WEIGHT column, so if we are to look into BMI's influence to the variable of interests, the negative values shall be removed since those are inaccurate measurements. For the ease of coding, negative BMI will also be encoded as NA's in the following analysis.

```{r}
train_full_copy3 <- data.frame(train_full_copy2)
train_full_copy3 <- train_full_copy3 %>% mutate(BMICategories = ifelse(is.na(HEIGHT) | is.na(WEIGHT), NA, BMICategories))
train_full_copy3 <- train_full_copy3 %>% mutate(BMI = ifelse(is.na(BMICategories), NA, BMI))
missing3 <- data.frame(map(train_full_copy3, ~sum(is.na(.))))
missing3 <- missing3[ , colSums(missing3 != 0) > 0]
sum(missing3)
# 
# 
# train_full_copy3$BMI <- train_full_copy3[train_full_copy3$BMI < 0]
# train_full_copy3$BMI <- train_full_copy3[train_full_copy3$BMI < 0]
```


## Random Forest with procedural/hospital information subset

df1[df1 == "N/A (bed-ridden or other medical issues)"] <- NA
missing4 <- data.frame(map(df1, ~sum(is.na(.))))
missing4 <- missing4[ , colSums(missing4 != 0, na.rm = TRUE) > 0]

Other_Drop0 <- names(missing4)[which(missing4 > 5000, arr.ind=T)[, "col"]]

df2 <- data.frame(train_full[, 78:107])
df2[df2 == "NULL"] <- NA
df2[df2 == "Unknown"] <- NA
missing5 <- data.frame(map(df2, ~sum(is.na(.))))
missing5 <- missing5[ , colSums(missing5 != 0, na.rm = TRUE) > 0]
missing5 <- data.frame(t(missing5))

# Columns to drop in Col 78-107

# All included in Other_Drop0

df_simplified_1 = drop_cols(df_simplified, Other_Drop0)
ncol(df_simplified_1)
```

```{r}
# Columns inspected here include: 'SEX', 'RACE_NEW', 'HIP_PREOP_DELIRIUM', 'HIP_WBAT_POD1', 'HIP_POST_DELIRIUM'
df3 <- data.frame(df_simplified_1[, c(
  'SEX',
  'RACE_NEW',
  'HIP_PREOP_DELIRIUM',
  'HIP_WBAT_POD1',
  'HIP_POST_DELIRIUM',
  'READMISSION1'
  )])
df3[df3 == "NULL"] <- NA
df3[df3 == "Unknown"] <- NA
df3[df3 == "N/A (bed-ridden or other medical issues)"] <- NA
df3 <- df3 %>% drop_na()
df3$READMISSION1[df3$READMISSION1 == 'Yes'] <- 1
df3$READMISSION1[df3$READMISSION1 == 'No'] <- 0
df3$SEX <- factor(df3$SEX)
df3$RACE_NEW <- factor(df3$RACE_NEW)
df3$HIP_PREOP_DELIRIUM <- factor(df3$HIP_PREOP_DELIRIUM)
df3$HIP_WBAT_POD1 <- factor(df3$HIP_WBAT_POD1)
df3$HIP_POST_DELIRIUM <- factor(df3$HIP_POST_DELIRIUM)
df3$READMISSION1 <- factor(df3$READMISSION1)
```

```{r}

sample = sample.split(df3$READMISSION1, SplitRatio = .75)
train = subset(df3, sample == TRUE)
test  = subset(df3, sample == FALSE)
dim(train)
dim(test)

rf <- randomForest(
  READMISSION1 ~ .,
  data=train
)

pred = predict(rf, newdata=test[-6])
cm = table(test[,6], pred)
cm
pred1 <- data.frame(pred)
```
From the RF result, it is initially considered that 'SEX', 'RACE_NEW', 'HIP_PREOP_DELIRIUM', 'HIP_WBAT_POD1', 'HIP_POST_DELIRIUM' are irrelevant parameters as well.
